## 🛠️ My Process

### 🧪 Built With

- 🧱 Semantic HTML5 markup  
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS  
- ⚙️ Vanilla JavaScript  
- 📐 Responsive design principles  
- 🤖 AI-assisted logic for dark/light mode toggle

### 📘 What I Learned

Switching from traditional CSS to Tailwind CSS was a major step in my frontend workflow. This project helped me get comfortable navigating Tailwind’s documentation and adjusting utility classes to fit component structure. I learned how to break down layout sections and apply styles modularly, improving both speed and consistency.

### 🔄 Continued Development

I’m actively working on deepening my understanding of Tailwind CSS and JavaScript by building components independently. While I used AI assistance for refining the input range slider logic, I aim to reduce reliance and strengthen my own problem-solving skills. Future projects will focus on mastering interactive elements and improving accessibility.

### 📚 Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) – This was my go-to reference for utility classes, layout adjustments, and responsive design patterns throughout the project.
